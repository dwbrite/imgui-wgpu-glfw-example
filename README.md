# STOP. Warning! (insert flashing police lights)

If you are like me and decided to use glfw because winit did not support Wayland very well, 
strongly reconsider. 

Winit is growing very fast and is probably the best window handler in existence right now.

## This example will not work on MacOS.

Do you enjoy Rust?

Are you interested in rendering and `imgui`?

Is your windowing library of choice glfw?

If you said yes to all of the above, this code will show you 
how to get that fantastic combination of libraries working together!
